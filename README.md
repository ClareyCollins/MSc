# MSc Data
The R Markdown file for the statistics and plots for my Masters thesis alongside the data files needed to run it

## Overview
In the interest of open science, I am providing the data gathered in my Masters research and providing the R script written to analyse the data.  I learnt R and statistics through the course of my Masters so please be kind and constructively point out errors or improvements in both my statistical knowledge and my coding or plot creations.

## Structure
The R markdown runs from the root folder and all data is placed in a folder 'data' and all outputs are written to a folder 'outputs'
