Non-parametric, multivariate analysis was carried out using non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) plots with the Bray-Curtis similarity index to visualise similarities and differences between plastic ingestion across the fish. 

Polymer type and colour were looked at separately, relating to location and species

Size of particle was looked at relating to location, species, weight and mouth area. The size of microparticle was split into six groups (0-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401–500 and, 501-5000μm), with the latter one being larger to enable us to understand the size spread across the majority (95%) of the particles.

The effect of laboratory environment on control plastic or composite particles was investigated using MDS to check the impact of changing environments.

ANOSIMs were run across all the MDS data to check for significant differences and where significant, pairwise comparisons of the groups were run to identify where the differences were.

Similarity percentages (SIMPERs) were then run to identify the percentage contributions of each variable to the result.

The nMDS, ANOSIMS and SIMPERs were implemented using the Primer v.7 (Primer-e, Auckland, NZ) software.
